        <h3>What are the differences between local storage vs session storage?</h3>
        <br />
        <p>
          Local Storage: <br />
          1. Local storage don't creats with every single new tab specifically. 2. Local storage collects data till no one delete or clear them. 3. Local storage size is 5mb to 10mb
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          Session Storage: <br />
          1. Session storage creates with every new tab creation. 2. It holds data for the time user works on that tab. 3. It's data is cleared with closing of browser or perticular tab. 4. Session storage size is 5mb.

        <h3>What are the differences between global scope vs block scope?</h3>
        <br />
        <p>
          Global Scope: <br />
          1. The variables defined outside of any function or curly brackets are known as global variables and have global scope. Global scope means that the variables can be accessed from any part of that program, any function or conditional state can access that variable.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          Block Scope: <br />
          1. The block scope can be defined as the scope of the variables inside the curly brackets {}. Now, these curly brackets can be of loops, or conditional statements, or something else. You are only allowed to refer to these variables from within the curly brackets {}.

        <h3>How does the Event Loop works in JavaScript?</h3>
        <br />
        <p>
          The event loop is the secret behind JavaScript's asynchronous programming. JS executes all operations on a single thread, but using a few smart data structures, it gives us the illusion of multi-threading. The Event Loop has one simple job to monitor the call stack and the callback queue
          or message queue. If the call stack is empty, it will take the first event from the callback queue and will push it to the call stack, which effectively runs it.

        <h3>Different ways to get undefined in javascript</h3>
        <br />
        <p>
          1. When you declare a variable and don’t initialize it to a value, the variable will have a value of undefined. <br />
          2. If you access a non-existing property of an object, you’ll get undefined. <br />
          3. When you call the function and don’t pass all the arguments, the parameters inside the function becomes undefined. <br />
          4. A function that doesn’t have a return statement implicitly returns undefined. <br />
          5. When you access an array element that is out-of-bounds, you’ll get the undefined value. <br />
